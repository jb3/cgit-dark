# cgit-dark

This repository houses my attempt at an (opinionated) dark theme for cgit using CSS media query selectors.

## Notes

- I've tried to maintain the light theme as-is, though I may have missed some elements and accidentally changed them.
- The main downside is likely that this colourscheme was written by someone who is colourblind, whilst I've checked it as best I can, some choices may not be the best.

## Known Todos

- Handle syntax highlighting better
- Handle markdown content better
